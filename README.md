# Traffic-Signal-Graphics-C

This repo contains a c source file of a computer graphics project demonstrating the basic working of traffic signal.

This animation can be used to demonstrate the working of traffic lights to kids in a cool way using programming.

The file is not a highly optimised piece of code and contains many beginner level stuff such as extensive use of goto statements etc.

Still a fun way to learn graphics
